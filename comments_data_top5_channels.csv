Loyalty is for lovers & families, business not so much.  Look at America, it used to be a production mecca. Did the businesses stay in the US when they realized they could make their products for pennies on the dollar in China?  I\'ll give you a hint, the answer starts with ""NO""!  Oscar is the type of person that makes it to Formula One....   Formula One!  He\'s not the type to sit around and trust others with his future.  It doesn\'t matter if Alpine had ""all the best k√©"", if you\'re not racing you are losing your edge .  This is a business!  Look how Alpine treated Alonso!  They thought he had no options so they tried to manipulate the situation. They wanted him to drive for them in F1 for one year then move to their endurance program.  That\'s not at all what he wanted but Alpine was looking out for (surprise!) Alpine.  Where was their loyalty to Alonso?

Since Wolff arrived at the helm that toxicity has been exacerbated. Lest we forget how in 2021 following the British Grand Prix, Wolff when asked about Verstappen\'s well-being ignored the question and simply said that he was looking forward to eating burgers that evening with his team. This question was put to Wolff when he knew that Verstappen was in hospital. Wolff is an odious individual. Contrast how it is clear that there is a healthy and respectful rivalry between Red Bull and Ferrari (team principals and drivers) and those who are suggesting that this is only the case because RB are so far ahead in the Championship are simply wrong. The respect that Horner and Verstappen had for Ferrari earlier in the season when they were behind Ferrari was very evident.

Yet, no one is raising an eyebrow at this ultra childish behavior from him, Lewis and Merc?\nAs if the constructors AGAIN doesn't matter.\nLike the SEVEN TIMES world champion before don't matter.\nLike anything other than winning blatantly and easily is a disgrace against the sport...\nSo, if it was up to Merc, the sport would not be called Formula 1, it would be called Mercedes 1 and only.\nBecause anyone that truly believes that this is about the actual rules, and about the actual sport for Toto and Merc, don't lie to yourself.\nThis is just about them having gotten so used to winning, that nothing else matters, and nothing else is acceptable.

The biggest is less about the weight, and more about the overall size of the cars.  They are simply too large, in external dimensions, to be able to give good racing on street circuit tracks, with Monaco being the worst of the bunch.  I think the FIA needs to take a different approach to the regulations.  Allow more freedom, but be stringent on the safety tests.  With the cost cap in place, teams cannot afford to just do anything now anyway, so having really stringent safety tests should be sufficient, and allows the teams to do whatever they want weight wise.  I think the cost cap opens up an opportunity, not just on weight, but on all aspects of the cars design, and they should leverage that fact moving forward.', 'Finally Lewis said something that I feel comfortable with, so maybe it will be better for him to stay out of other topics.

Just look at a side by side shot of the 2002 Ferrari and the 2017 Ferrari. It's easy to Google, and is really eye-opening."", ""What I want to see from the Future in F1: A development platform to advance not only motorsport, but automotive engineering in its entirety. To me, F1 is the NASA of land; able to go to new horizons that simply can't be sailed to cheaply nor quickly. We support the entertainment of racing as a fun and exciting endeavor, but the beating heart of that excitement is knowing that in many ways, this is the product of the greatest technology and skill on display. I want to see that skill and technology be used to continuously develop better, focused technologies that will benefit racing, but most importantly benefit every vehicle that gets produced going forward. Cheaper and more sustainable manufacturing techniques, lighter and stronger materials, continued exponential gains in safety, unending streams of sensor data for autonomous control training, so much focused and dedicated engineering to every nut, bolt, gasket and down to the atoms of the materials themselves. Motorsport retains the capacity to push humanities automotive capacity to limitless potential, and building a better, lighter car I feel should be a great goal.""]"

They complain about how there are fewer engine manufacturers than ever before, how that is making a handful of teams incredibly powerful with technology transfers and unfair advantages. Then they claim they are only doing what manufacturers want by making sustainability a key aspect. But quite obviously that isn\'t working - if you need to spend 10 times as much to develop an engine with the majority of the money going towards tech which has no foreseeable future on road cars then it isn\'t a great offer to manufacturers.\n\nMaking the engines cheaper to design by removing all sustainability and efficiency goals would instantly bring more companies into the sport, indeed many could share some of the tech they use in other motorsport engines.

The reason is the bottleneck formed by the side pods on the Redbull RB18 and on other cars.\r\nAssuming that models of Redbull RB18 and Mercedes W13 were made of slippery/soapy material, it would be impossible to lift the Mercedes around the side pods due to its triangular cross-section; but one would easily lift the Redbull RB18 below the side pods. This is what aerodynamic flow at high speeds does. Whereas the Mercedes is just pressed down by air but lifted up by mechanical suspension springs. The aerodynamic envelope around the Redbull RB18 gets more effective the faster the car moves, and as such dampens the tendency to porpoise. Thus, the body is pressed down and lifted up by the same aerodynamic flow - but different in magnitudes down and up. The resultant effect is that the car body moves in an aerodynamic equilibrium, shaped like the letter - C - turned over by 90¬∞. If one imagines the way an umbrella can be flipped over in stormy weather, then one can reckon that the aerodynamic envelope around Redbull RB18‚Äôs side pods stabilizes the car body to such an extent that porpoising is fully attenuated. The fact that aerodynamic loads pressing the car down and lifting it up around the side pods increase or decrease in equilibrium, engineers simply have to make fine adjustments to get maximum downforce without porpoising. Redbull RB18‚Äôs mechanical suspension therefore only dampens the usual track surface vibration and does not cause any oscillatory movement - porpoising. Even if it were to porpoise slightly, the aerodynamic ‚Äúenvelope-‚Äù would counteract by proportionately damping the tendency; Mercedes, on the other hand, is simply pressed down 100% aerodynamically but lifted up 100% mechanically ‚Äì thus the cause of porpoising. Mercedes has no choice but to emulate Redbull RB18 by using the side-pod bottleneck.  One cannot go around physics by a ‚Äútrial and error‚Äù approach; one must have an objective that is economically, legally, scientifically, and technically viable.']"

Clever engineers would look at Ferrari or Red Bull once and know what is good in their cars. Get fresh inventive people like me, who can read minds and decern the ideas of rival engineers. This is what Mercedes should do: 1) Reinforce the underbody so that there is no deformation under load. 2) Measure transient pressure under the body within one qualifying lap. Then install a spoiler valve to relieve the underbody pressure at 90% of maximum pressure, which is just before the laminar flow stalls. 3) if this works better, now vary the %-ge from 80% to 95% and monitor the lap time fluctuation. If you are not allowed to vary the pressure during the race, then run the system at 90%, thus 10% below maximum pressure. This way, you get rid of purpoising. Thanks to comments here, I can now prove that I told Wolf that Bottas was sabotaging both Mercedes and Hamilton. Later on, other people told Wolff openly, but he said that was not how Mercedes operated. But of late, Bottas has regularly been making comments that corroborate the fact that he was indeed not a team player at Mercedes ... He threw away points that could have enabled Lewis to win the Championship outright. Toto, you don't need to be good to bad people.

No - if a team tumbles down the order because they constantly DNF, or have to run high-ride height and can\'t get the downforce to go fast, then it sucks to be that team, and they should go away and design a new car.\n\nFurther, when it comes to tyres, I have long hated the ""must use two compounds (except wet races)\' rule.\nBack when teams could select their own compounds for upcoming races - that was a slight improvement, however I would go one step further - which I will cover on in a minute. The recent rule from a couple years ago to limit races to just ""Soft"", ""Medium"", and ""Hard"" nomenclature irrespective of compound, was a step backwards.\n\nIMO, teams should be allowed to bring a set number of tyre sets to every Grand Prix weekend, and they can be ANY tyre compounds. If a backmarker team wants to bring Super Hards and run a 0 stop race to climb and climb the order, then so be it. If another team wants 10 sets of Hypersofts, and to pit every 6 laps, then so be it. On the argument for F1 emissions/efficiency/green strategies, maybe limit every driver to 10 sets x (however many races - in 2022\'s instance; 22), and each driver can have 220 tyres across the year. The team sits down, and they discuss tyre strategies, and request maybe 5 Super Hards, 20 Hards, 60 Mediums, 60 Softs, 40 Super Softs, 20 Ultra Softs, and 15 Hypersofts, for the year. Then Pirelli goes and makes the tyres as required, allowing any unused sets from Race weekends to be added back into the Drivers\' pool, and swapped in for another set for an upcoming race if shipping timeframes allow.\n\nEither way, a top-ish team might go extreme on the softer tyres early in the season to try win races and build a points buffer, but later in the season they risk tumbling down the order because they have to bring Hards, and Mediums to lower deg tracks, and many other teams still have softer compound sets remaining. It can mean that if you always bring a set of Hyper/Ultra Soft tyres, then a Safety Car a few laps from the end can always allow you to strap on the softest rubber to smash some overtakes that maybe your opponents can\'t.\n\nThe strategic narrative for tyres will not only play out across a race as some drivers have polar-opposite tyre strategies, but it would also play out across the season whereby you might have begged-borrowed-and-stolen your sets on a campaign, and you are forced into heading to the last race with far-from ideal tyre compounds because you committed to more sets of a particular compound than you actually ended up using, and now you\'re stuck so that Pirelli aren\'t making tyres that never get used!\n\nIt would be very difficult for casual fans to follow, but would be a gripping battle to ananlyse for more serious fans!\n\nWith regards to the Ferrari assistance to their ""customer teams"", I\'m fairly sure about 6 years ago the sport regulated that customer teams had to be offered the same specification engine as the OEM team - to stop cash-strapped teams from only ""affording"" last years\' engine. I don\'t think the regulation required sharing of optimal engine oil specs - as that would be a propriety product of the lubricant supplier - however I\'m pretty sure the Ferrari car Ferrari engine is physically identical to the HAAS car Ferrari engine. Same with Gearboxes; a Ferrari car Ferrari gearbox is the same as a customer team Ferrari Gearbox. I think I saw that maybe Aston Martin manufacturer a new gearbox case, but the internals are all still Mercedes, but they went with that pathway to optimise suspension mounting points. I think Katy was off the mark on that comment.\n\nAs for the progression of F2 drivers to F1, I feel that the value of existing and even ""washed up"" F1 drivers in teams of car setup/development and testing in the simulator just outstrips the value of a thirsty young driver. If people want more young drivers, there needs to be more genuine physical testing allowed, that might even be limited to only junior category drivers. The bans on in-season testing would need to be relaxed. Maybe a small monetary increase to the budget cap to ""equalise"" the opportunity for teams, but as long as testing is like rare-earth metals, and seldom comes by, then there\'s no competition for teams when it comes to decide on the poorer racecraft older driver that can setup/develop/provide valuable feedback, and a junior driver that potentially is going to just throw ideas around, and tell warries about how they fixed a setup issue with their F2 car once upon a time.', '1st = Red Bull...................2nd = Mercedes...........................3rd = McLaren.....................4th = Ferrari', ""what are the glasses ya'll drinkin out of?"", 'Tommy just spoke out my greatest fear üò≠', 'Why\'s Matt looking so built, literally been training to say ""not a fanboy, just passionate!"" this year?', 'Tom you and that dog are like Max and Alonso.

If the answer is no, and the car passes safety tests and is not lets say 20 feet long or whatever it can race. Let the engineers of the teams make new stuff.', 'Katy.... Looking super cute...', ""Also Tommy, on your point on strategy in races being hampered by these new tires. Maybe on the flipside, if two cars that are relatively evenly matched are pushing ahead, overtakes will become more reliant on driver skill. So if a Ferrari driver that's behind an RB is faster in the right places, just add DRS and it'll be a hugely entertaining battle because the Ferrari will have to dig deep to either force a mistake from the RB that's been under pressure for many laps, or to just pass the RB through better choice of lines.""]"

You can get either:\n1 x 100km race on Saturday, and 1 x 300km race on Sunday, or\n1 x 150km race on Saturday, and 1 x 250km race on Sunday.\n\nEither way 400km total racing.\n\nSecond is International SuperSprint format, where you get:\n1 x 200km race on Saturday, and 1 x 200km race on Sunday. Again, a total of 400km racing.\n\nThird is SuperStreet format, where you get either:\n1 x 250km race on Saturday, and 1 x 250km race on Sunday, for a total of 500km racing, or\n1 x 200km race on Saturday, and 1 x 200km race on Sunday, for a total of 400km racing.\n\nFourth is the Enduro Cup format, where we either get:\n1 x 500km race on Sunday, or\n1 x 1,000km race on Sunday, or\n1 x 300km race on Saturday, and 1 x 300km race on Sunday.\n\nBeyond all that, there are a plethora of qualifying formats ranging from time limited formats, or distance limited qualifying races, or timed sessions and afterwards Top 10 shootouts.\n\nCrucial to all this is that points are awarded to every car, and each ""event"" or ""race meet"" yields the same number of points no matter what. (Just go with their points for this explanation - though I don\'t think F1 should use these numbers)\n\nWhat this means is that for the 1 x 1,000km race, or 1 x 500km race, the winner gets 300 points, and 2nd gets 276, and 3rd gets 258 points. When two races are held over the ""event"", the winner from each races gets 150 points, whilst 2nd gets 138 points, and 3rd gets 129 points. Back when they sometimes had 3 races over a weekend, it was 100 for the win, 92 for 2nd, and 86 for 3rd. They even had a 4 race weekend format at one point meaning that 1 x 1,000 race win (even by dumb luck - like the leader running out of fuel on the last lap), was equal to 4 wins in 75km races, with 4 lots of race start jeopardy, and 4 lots of strategy possibilities, and extra chances for a faster car that crashes out to start a new race and have another crack rather than being out for good.\n\nSo I\'m not saying that F1 should go crazy having almost no two events with the same amount of races and preceeded by the same qualifying system, but they could maybe have one standard qualifying, and 3 race format.\n\nMaybe F1 could have 2 x 150km races for newer races, 1 x 300km race for established and long-time member Grand Prix\'s, and 1-3 ""premiere"" events of maybe 500-600km.\n\nGive points from 1st to 26th (and just not bother with points for places not filled by lack of teams).\n\nMaybe 100 points for an ""event"" win (or 50 per win at a 2 race ""event""), and maybe double points at ""premiere"" events - I\'m thinking like Monza, Silverstone, Spa-Francorchamps maybe...\n\nThat would mean that the incentive to go for the extra spot is amplified at premiere events, and the jeopardy is magnified if you crash out. Likewise, smaller events get more actual ""races"", and a mistake can be somewhat clawed back in the race the next day.\n\nAs most ""events"" will still be single race formats, the ""purity"" of the sports heritage will be somewhat preserved (in that regard), but more so, the longer, extra points-worth ""events"" will provide Formula 1 with that ""headline event"".\n\nPeople speak about Monaco being the ""Jewel in the Crown"" of F1, but it\'s actually a pretty garbage race. Most fans love it for the Qualifying, but seldom find a fan that loves it for the racing - it\'s actually the shortest F1 race of the year. The Indianapolis 500; the 24 Heurs du Le Mans, the Bathurst 1,000km, the Monte Carlo Rallye - some are the longest individual events of their categories, whilst some are equally as long as others within their category, but all command a premiere position due to the arduous nature of them; in all, the battle swings to and fro. Formula 1\'s ""premiere"" event is a snore-fest that is almost completing devoid of ANY on track overtakes. What an indictment!\n\n\nFormula 1 should be brave to try new things.

But if someone does bad in Friday quali and are at the end in Saturday sprint quali race, then they need some incentive to gain places n be able to take risks of damage taht might make or break their race on Sunday the main race. Hence some compensation for the risks taken would make drivers n teams (especially midfield and back end teams) motivated for riskier moves and not worrying too much about the main race too much, hence making it exciting as well. But if their risks were fruitful, they'll have an opportunity to gain a position they can't gain otherwise in during conventional race weekend. This has potential to give very exciting racing n surprising Sunday results as the grid positions will become a lot more dynamic than ever.\n\nIf this kind of reward system is implemented, it also makes Saturday race unique from the Sunday main race not taking Sunday race hype from it. Both will have their unique own type of agenda making both intersting in their own way rather than same Race duplicates.\n As Saturday race will be more about overtaking, Sunday race will be about team strategy, racing, going at it, driver skills to hold up to the strategy, and all other good things."", 'Who‚Äôs here in the 2 weeks before Silverstone', 'It might actually work out well if you think about it, the top teams are not going to push super hard they are not going to risk crashing for 3 points but the bottom teams have nothing to loose, so I might actually be very good.', 'People are obviously initially resistant to change but when they see that it provides more quality viewing and excitement (compared to Friday practice) it will sway opinions in favour of the sprint race', ""I have an idea for qualifying. Q1 team mate vs team mate, splitting the teams to front and back half of the grid. Q2 the back half 11 to 20 the loosing team members Q3 the front of the grid. So you'd get Bottas beating Hamilton on pole , Hamilton 11th, Russell around 5th and so much overtaking in the mid field. No team strategy having 2 cars working together plus fun teammate battles in Q3 but less chance of teammates running into each other in the race.

I was 8 at the time and had casually watched it in the past but that year I genuinely became interested. I remember randomly watching one of the races on the TV and asking my dad, ""Who\'s leading?"" He said, ""Sebastian Vettel. He\'s the world champion and drives for Red Bull"". I didn\'t know much at the time so I instantly became a Vettel fan. I think it was just destiny in the end as I knew nothing about him yet he\'s still my favourite driver up to this day. I can\'t remember which race that was however. The earliest memory I have was seeing Nico Rosberg\'s front wing failing a few races later. I looked it up a few months and found out it was at the Korean GP. I also remember being impressed that he was winning literally every race I watched. It made me question whether I had missed something or not. The truth is I had no clue I was watching him break a world record. I may be wrong but I think I have a faint memory of him becoming world champion at India and him doing those donuts. Anyway, I had become a massive fan. The interesting thing is this was a year before I moved to England. So, despite being Italian, I didn\'t support Ferrari at all. Fernando was still my second favourite driver but I never wished he won. I always wanted Seb and Red Bull to win, which is what I got. The next season was a horrible experience for me as a kid however. I still remember seeing Daniel getting a P2 in Australia. I also remember hearing about his disqualification on the radio later on in the evening. At first, I didn\'t think much of the first race. But as the season progressed, I started to have less motivation. It hurt me to see Seb wasn\'t at the front anymore. Most of the times, he was around 5th, sometimes not even in the top 10. It hurt me so bad that I completely lost interest in F1. Later that year, I moved to the UK. Of course, you can imagine how happy everyone was to see Lewis win. I remember we had a school assembly once where they played a video and talked about the new world champion, Lewis Hamilton, though I wasn\'t particularly happy as I wanted to see Seb win. Of course, the British fans were happy about his championship. I remember I tried to feel something for him but I just couldn\'t, I wanted Seb to win so I just didn\'t see a point in watching F1, especially considering Seb had just moved to Ferrari even though I wanted him to stay at Red Bull. Last year, 7 years later, a video from Vox about the Monaco Grand Prix got in my recommended. I watched it and started having interest in F1 again. It was a bit of a shock to see everything having changed so much. It was also a bit of a shock to me when I found out everyone hated Seb during his dominance as I obviously didn\'t have social media when I was a child so I couldn\'t have known at the time. I only found out last year. I supported Max in the championship but only because I wanted a bit of change and Red Bull to win. But, of course, it was quite painful to see Seb at Aston Martin. There have only been 3 races this season but I\'m just scared to watch the Imola GP this weekend because I fear Seb isn\'t gonna perform well again. Last year, I had high hopes and even dreamed a 5th world championship. Instead, he got Covid-19 and a horrendous car. Ironically, between Max and Charles, I support Charles but that\'s only because I like him more and don\'t feel like wanting another period of domination by Max quite frankly.

With the teams getting different sums of money from F1/Fia they are bound to be unequal and with suggestions that the cars are too fast for some circuits the whole set up is false, unfair and not a sport and the best rivers do not win. F1 needs to reduce the costs, forget about paying Ferrari, do away with driver aids, make the drivers responsible for driving the cars in accordance with the confines of the circuit, the car and their ability, come up with fair regulations which do not give all advantages to the teams with the most money, stop trying to choreograph things to make it faster, more dangerous and more exciting for the uninformed spectator who only wants to see crashes.\nReverse Grids ceased because with the slower cars and lowest experienced drivers ( due to costs  ) tended to cause accidents as the richer  teams and driver, who were obviously quicker, tried to overtake\nIf F1 and the Fia Mafia did not worship their God Money and open up their closed shop mentality by following a path of fairness, safety and SPORT the World would be a better place all round!']"

It's like the penalty kick in football, that most of the time significantly changes the outcome of the event. I think F1 needs another type of penalty that is like a red card in football that doesn't immediately change the outcome, it just gives a disadvantage to the penalized party. This should allow the drivers to change their strategies in light of the penalty but still require them to fight for the better position.\n\nI have a few ideas:\n1. Implement a 1 or 2 seconds time penalty. Cars have a hard time to follow each other this close, so it becomes a strategic question whether to overtake the car with the penalty anyway or fall back and come back at the end of the race, which can be quite risky. A safety car near the end of the race can also play a role.\n2. Require the car with the penalty to take a longer racing line, e.g. take an extra corner or chicane. This can apply for a number of laps or the entire race. This would slow down the penalized car slightly, allowing other cars to catch up and overtake. Unfortunately not all tracks would allow this and safety is a big question with this idea (see the 2005 US GP), so I don't think this can be implemented in practice.\n3. Reduce the power of the penalized car. You can take away DRS (keep in mind that DRS is also used when lapping cars), reduce the RPM of the ICE, or reduce the power output of the hybrid components. This can also apply for a number of laps or the entire race. This would have a similar effect of the second idea, but it is less visible for the fans and it feels more artificial. But it's simple to implement and gives plenty of options to refine.\n4. Restrict the strategic options with the tires. There are many options with this, but it's quite tricky to implement as the tire strategies of the cars are not known in advance. It also feels very artificial.\n\nP.S.

647,e1hKEKnfFm8,"['What a shitty video...', 'I have some words of encouragement in the midst of what\'s going on. It might sound wierd, but it is for real and I thought it would be important to say it.\n\nIts long because I\'ve tried to and any faqs! \nHopefully this will answer some of those nagging questions - \nWhy can\'t evil be forgiven and let off, how is the whole ""Jesus dying"" thing really relevant to anything? To you?  if you still have any questions let me know x\n\nEver struggle? Ever doubt that God Loves You After what you\'ve done? Ever wonder if He exists for that matter? Read this:\n\nAll of us have lied, stolen (even tiny things count), spoken badly to our parents and had embarrassing and detestable thoughts in our thought life. The Bible calls this ""sin"", the breaking of God\'s laws. You might think, so what? Everyone lies and thinks bad things about others! Its human!\n\nYou\'re right. That\'s exactly what the Bible says, we\'re ""born into sin"" and that ""all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God"" - Romans @\n\nWhat is that ""glory"", morally speaking?\nWell, the opposite of human nature and desires.\nNot lying, not stealing, and having a perfect thought life is God\'s standard for us. \n\nBut if its God\'s standard and we were made in ""God\'s image"", Why don\'t we meet it? \nWell, Remember Adam and Eve and when they sinned. Before sin they were perfect in thought word and DEED completely, but after the first sin occured due to Satan\'s tempting in the Garden, it destroyed that part of us that was morally perfect and in perfect harmony with God\'s morals, standard, and love. So while we kept certain things, the ability to be thinking individuals with unique personalities, the moral part (affecting how our thoughts, actions and personalities operate) was damaged. To the point where we are ""opposed"" to God, hence His nature and standards being the opposite of what we see as reasonable or possible. The Bible even makes it clear that ""apart from God you can do nothing"" - John 15:5. Without Him, it will 100% feel ""opposite"", unreasonable and alien to us. Only WITH Him can we gain victory in these things.\n\nWhy doesn\'t God just let sin off and leave it?\nGod is described as a ""righteous judge"" in the bible, many wonder why God doesn\'t just let sin off and leave it, but He can\'t. Why? That\'s like a if a judge let off a \nmurderer who broke the state law. Everyone would attack that judge and call Him corrupt, saying that he had not done right and should be fired for failing to punish the murderer for his evil. AND to completely love and be good as God is, means you need to, in turn, hate all forms of evil. You can\'t truly love good unless you hate the existence of evil.\n\nThis essentially means that God needed, as a righteous judge to punish sin with the ultimate penalty of death and separation from His presence forever. Hence Hell.\n\n""The soul that sins shall die (in Hell and suffer damnation)"" - Ezekiel @\n\nBut God, who is also love, did not want to see His creation tortured and cut off from Him. He cares so much for is that He couldn\'t bear to see us fall into Satans hands and suffer death, even though we broke the law and deserve to bear the guilt, pain and be cut off from perfection forever through damnation.\n\nBecause of justice, God could not leave sin and evil unpunished, BUT because of LOVE, God provided someone else to take that punishment on our behalf, satisfying both justice (by punishing the evil committed), and love (by sparing OUR lives) despite our sin.  \n\nGod sent His own SON - think about that. His *Son*, the one whom He loved infinitely (the same way He loves us).\n\nGod allowed Him to take the pain we deserved, He took ALL of Gods wrath for every single sin you and I have committed. He was punished brutally and completely as if He was the picture of mankind\'s sin itself so that we do not have to be punished. \n\nBack in the courtroom scenario: He paid the ""fine"" at His own expense (His life had to be morally perfect on this Earth, then He had to be killed as a sinless sacrifice on our behalf).\nSo when He returns to remove all evil from the face of the Earth, we can be spared and free because Christ has already BEEN punished on our behalf. He then rose again on the third day, conquering not only life and sin and temptation, but DEATH. \n\n""I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live (immortallly and eternally in Heaven when I return)"" - John @-26\n\nALL we have to do is accept it by faith. Faith alone in Christ alone.\n\nReligion = rules to be saved\n\nThe gospel = Christ saved us already we just have to believe it by faith. If you lack faith (as I did before), pray. He will make it strong it time. Trust Him as you would trust those close to you. He knows you even better than that. He created you and knows you inside out.\n\n...WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nWhat does it actually mean for us?\nIt means we can be completely free from the penalty of damnation.\nNot only that but we can be restored to Him and recreated into His moral image AGAIN as long as we accept Jesus having paid the price for us and accept Him as our Lord, the one who is in the front seat of our lives. He has a plan for your life, He\'s created you for a purpose. Just remember that. A purpose that includes being recreated into His image, one you can only accomplish through Him and reliance on His power and by following HIS way of life. \n\nWhat is this new way entail?\n\nIt entails love, true love and service and aid to others, to ""love God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength"" and ""love your neighbour as you love yourself"" Matthew @, 39. \n\nSharing the message of Christ\'s death, resurrection and soon return on this Earth to give justice OR mercy depending on what the person chose.\n\nSound ""opposite"" again? \nGod knows it sounds opposite, which is why, as The Bible states, this is NOT something we can do alone. It\'s not in our nature. \n\nWe need a new nature in the front seat,  and the first step is to repent (turn from and reject our sin, pursuing the opposite direction and drawing close to God)\n\nChrist will give us an actual DESIRE to do these things. Through the, Holy Spirit, sent by Him to us after the ascension. He speaks to us through thoughts, verses, ideas and prayers and guides us so that we gain a desire to follow God and be able to do these ""opposite"" things through Him.\n...\nWhat is the way FOR though?\nFirstly its to save you from sin - the only way to gain victory over sin and not have it as your master is through having Christ as your master and following His aid to resist the devil\'s temptations.\n\nChrist lived down here for 33 years suffering EVERY FORM of temptation that you have ever faced - ""who in every respect [has] been tempted as we are, yet without sin"" Hebrews @.\n\nTherefore He is able to help us through our struggles. When the devil knows people have left his camp, he always tries harder with more temptations and evil attacks. BUT - His way is also there to guard and teach you daily in the midst of this (and despite this) sinful, selfish world.\n\nThe path He wants you to walk is one of committment and love - its not about rules and regulations to save us - what Christ did GAVE us salvation. All we need is faith to believe it. The rest, the ""fruits of good works (the will to obey and follow Him)"", are what come through true, maturing faith. It\'s all about faith and the relationship God wants with you just like before sin arrived. \n\nGod preferred His own Son to be tortured and killed to give a chance to us (who broke His law of perfection) so that we can live as His children again. He wants us to love and trust and worship Him.\n\nWhat if I still sin after accepting Christ?\n\nThat\'s why Christ died, For our sin. His death doesn\'t fix us in a snap like that, but it does protect us from the damnation that our past, present and future sins would bring without Jesus.\n\nIt\'s a process - a lifelong one - of God bringing you back to Him and away from the destructive pleasures of sin (think greed, selfish temptations, trampling on people to gain). This process takes a *lifetime*, as it does for all, but NEVER give up, when you fall, know Christ paid for that sin you committed already - just acknowledge your sin and ask for forgiveness - and you can get back up again because He already bore your guilt and shame.\n\nRegardless of the darkness you are in or the extent or frequency of the sins you have committed or will commit, regardless of how doubtful you may feel, know that Jesus UNDERSTANDS completely and He is faithful. \n\n""those who come to Me, I will by no means cast out"" - John @\n\n...HOW DO I LEARN MORE?\n\nDon\'t know where to start?\nNote down the Gospel of ""John"", or ""Luke"" (if you want a more detailed account of it all).\n\nRemember that He will ""NEVER - and that means never - leave you, NOR forsake you"" - Deuteronomy 31:6 \n\nRegardless of what goes on down here, God knows, Jesus has been down here and felt all the emotions you are feeling. You can go to Him with them and be assured that He loves you and is for you. \nEven in the storm, God is still there, walking on the water alongside you.\n\nKeep your heart open to Him and remember that if we pray for Christ to enter our lives, He will. \n\n""For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only begotten Son, that whomever believes in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life"". - John @\n\nThanks for reading if you did x.

Same with how with League of Legends as an e-Sport started out, people had low expectations for the game to launch off as something people would enjoy watching yet it has and millions more people watch professionals play League of Legends in a stadium or/and their own home more than the amount of people who watch Football(both american and european) and hockey. Yet it is still looked down upon as not a sport and people wondering why anyone would want to watch someone playing a video game.\nI have personally been to a live Baseball, Hockey, and Football(american) game, oh and a few Le mans and F1 Races. Yet I find those sports so boring compared to the video games i enjoy to watch and play. The amount of activity involved or strategy is so lackluster compared to the video games I can watch today, I start to fall asleep early before anything exciting might happen. \nThe worst sport of all in my opinion is Football(american). On average the running on plays in that game are about 20 minutes. Yet the entire game lasts for about 3 hours in most cases. Now imagine to use all those strategies that take time to adjust and simulate on the field all at once without stopping. That would be the typical adjustment needed to play games like League of Legends or other high live action strategy games. There are no rest periods, only action.

A low polar moment of inertia (having the bulk of the weight toward the middle) makes the car rotate much more easily, which obviously helps to take turns faster. An example of this physics principal is when a figure skater spins, if she pulls her arms in toward her body, she spins much faster, and conversely, she spins more slowly when stretching her arms back out. The difference in rotational speed is huge just by moving the weight of her arms close and farther from her body. You can imagine how much difference it makes by moving a heavy engine toward the middle of a car; it makes the car rotate much more freely (which is a double edge sword because it makes it easier to spin out).

If Red Bull is designing the actuator to have just enough strength to open the wing in normal conditions, I wonder if the binding you mention, combined with the added load that a large Barcelona rear wing would've entailed meant that the actuator wasn't able to reliably hold the wing open. Binding doesn't seem like the only factor to me, since the DRS would reliably work on the short back straight. The wind I feel is the main reason that the system wouldn't reliably work down the pit straight. \n\nCould it be that the combined conditions made it that the force exerted on it were simply more than the actuator was meant to handle or could the components have been faulty?\n\nThe numbers below are all imaginary, I just want to illustrate my point. \n-The Red Bull DRS actuator provides 200N of force to open the Rear wing\n-A RB18 In regular trim with a normal wing, assuming standard atmospheric conditions requires 150N to reliably actuate the DRS\n\nThen, let's look at the factors I think might be at play for Max in Barcelona:\n-Larger rear wing: +20N (larger wing weighs more, and also generates more downforce which means it requires more force to open)\n-Headwind: anywhere from +10N to +30N (the intensity of the wing changed quite a bit from lap to lap)\n-Binding, excess friction, poor component fit or warping: anywhere from +5N to +15N (this can vary from lap to lap, and might be worsened if the car is being jarred by running on the kerbs)\n\nSo, if the Red Bull usually has 50N of excess force in normal circumstances, this becomes 30N once the larger than average rear wing gets fitted. That 30N of reserve might simply not be enough to reliably open the wing when the wind is blowing especially strong, or when the parts in the rear wing assembly are being especially troublesome. \n\nAnother possibility that I simply cannot comment on further is that there was some sort of electronic fault that convinced the system it needed to close the DRS flap on the main straight, but was completely absent when Verstappen was on the back straight."", 'Why not just give them a spray with WD40?', 'Please do a video that analyses if 2022 cars deliver their promise to have closer racing']"

The World Championship and the Constructor's Championship. People say it would make the race all about the machine while the drivers are relegated to being the luggage. But that wouldn't happen with the right regulations. If the drivers had to control what the machine was doing in real time that wouldn't happen. For example, what if the drivers had control of the roll of the car in real time allowing them the lean harder or less aggressively into a corner? What if the drivers had control of the down-force provided by both front and rear wings to give drivers more control over under-steer and over-steer, perhaps even in combination with the brake bias? Anytime you give the drivers more control over their machines abilities as well as when and how they're used I think it leads to better racing.

The fact that it made the season more exciting and that this is the way you and others race doesn\'t make it less aggressive. What Max does by running down on the inside of the corner then basically running wide of the apex to force his wheels in front of an opponent is similar to what they call a block pass in motocross.

A ""true racing"" pass is where you are able to pass another driver WITHOUT becoming an obstacle on the track that has to be avoided.

He steers with the rear wheels and neutralises oversteer/understeer through the entire cornering. Whilst flicking the back out with a controlled slide, the car is pointing in the right direction (down the straight) meters after the apex and he's at full throttle before the corner has been fully taken.

I didn\'t realize he turned so far left and aggressively before Hill arrives.\n\nThen there\'s what follows.\n\nMy take:\n\nThis was a bitter title fight, and I\'m sure Schumacher was acting mostly on instinct after an unplanned hit of the wall.\n\nHe simply didn\'t have time to make elaborate ""cheat"" calculations in those moments.\n\nBut in those few seconds, he knew the car was critically damaged. And he knew letting Hill through would lose him the championship. The competitive instinct of Michael would have kicked in.\n\n\nI think his unusual steering left was to block Hill from the outside, knowing he\'d have to take the inside. Then he turned in.\n\nIt was the only card left for Schumacher to play if he has a chance of winning the championship.\n\nIs it cheating? By the letter of the law, I don\'t think so, because, as you show in your analysis, Schumacher is ahead before turning into the corner.\n\nBut the situation is manufactured by Schumacher.\n\nSchumacher goes from the extreme left of the track (unnecessary) to the extreme right.

Cornering in and setting the throttle is all well and good, but you modulate the brakes to shift weight around to dictate what tires get the most bite on the dirt.', 'Also a quick fix to combat under steer.', 'What about preventing understeer/oversteer on FF and MR/RR cars, and keeping the load/balance of these cars in check while cornering?', 'Tested left foot braking in a sim (AssettoCorsa, I think it has the best physics) because I haven‚Äôt had the chance to drive to the limit a paddle-shift car in real-life. And in the sim I got 1.5 seconds off my PB. My opinion is that left foot braking is faster only if you are on the limit because you can balance the car while it rotates (even applying some throttle can stabilize). So you can simply have more speed before the apex and on exit because of that smooth weight transfer and suspension loading and unloading. Again, I don‚Äôt think it will make you faster if you are not already at the limit, my suggestion is don‚Äôt bother because you‚Äôll get overloaded.', 'I think it unclogs nose congestion for some reason. Try it and report back.', 'Left foot braking is an excellent way to manipulate brake bias when used with precise amounts of throttle overlap. \n\nFor instance, a front wheel drive car, left foot braking would effectively reduce front brake torque, resulting in a more rearward brake bias that could sharpen corner entry in a much more controlled fashion then pulling the hand brake.\n\nFor a RWD drownforce heavy car, LFB enables more rearward brake bias settings to be used to maximize the benefits of drownforce, especially when braking from high speeds. As brake pedal pressure is progressively reduced as speed drops and so does drownforce induced grip, the throttle can be carefully added to balance the brake bias and prevent rear lockup and sharpen corner entry.\n\nFor a 4WD car, it depends on many factors such as diff setup and F/R torque distribution. For instance, a rally car can be setup to open the front and central diffs under deceleration to enable quicker vehicle yaw and lockup all diffs as hard as possible under power for maximum traction under acceleration.', 'Another benefit is the ability to keep your boost levels up on forced induction cars to reduce lag. Essentially keeping the rpms at the best operating range. Working on that myself on my S4 mt. I learned about it by watching a documentary on the group B Quattro history.

It is ridiculous that F1 management demands from Andretti for them to show they are serious competitor with enough resources and enough money and enough exposure in USA so that marketing would be right.\r\nFirst off, Andretti is competing with huge success for YEARS in IndyCar Series but also Indy Lights, Indy Pro 2000, Formula E, Extreme E and Supercars Championship. How much more serious you need to get?\r\nSecondly, the first point already proves that they have resources to build, maintain and develop the car and the team. Otherwise, they would be racing in back of the pack, which is not the case.\r\nThirdly, you have to have huge amounts of money to compete in all those series (and be successful at the same time). What is more, with the success Andretti had, it also shows it is money well spent. What is more, Andretti stated already he is willing to pay mandatory F1 entry fee 200 milions of USD (which is then distributed to all other F1 teams as compensation of future lower income - prize pot is pretty much the same, but there would be one more team to share the money with. But hear also this - Andretti wouldn't get ANY money from F1 management for one or two years just because they are new team to the series.)\r\nLastly, Andretti is known as motorsport figure. His name is called the synonymous of speed, just as Stirling Moss - we are talking here about Mario Andretti. When it comes to Andretti family, they are bound to motorsport for several decades. Mario is last American F1 Champion (!) which he won in 1978 driving Lotus with Ford engine, he also won 12 races. Mario also won 4 IndyCar titles, Indy 500 and Daytona 500. Mario's son - Michael, also a competetive driver himself and he now runs the team business. Then we have Marco, Michael's son, who also is a driver, who competed in IndyCar, American Le Mans Series, Formula E and couple other series. I mean, damn, do you feel the marketing potential here? Please also add Colton Herta, who is widely considered a huge talent and is now a development driver for McLaren F1 team.\r\nTaking all this into consideration one must ask themself - what is wrong with F1? What the heck do they really want? And how the hell F1 allowed such a joke of a team of Haas into the series? Well, imho there is one answer - Hass is no danger to the top teams, Andretti very much can be, and which team in their right mind would allow another serious competitor into F1 circus? That's why they do not want Andretti in F1, because they might be too good to beat or to compete with, especially with budget cap (remember, Haas is planning their ONE AND ONLY update for Hungaroring, next they will be focusing on 2023 car :D McLaren is also out of major updates for this year.

88,yD3HFdj0Ffo,"[""I'd like to point three things out, all pertaining to Williams.\n\n1) Albon had the pace to keep up with Ocon. He was only 1.5 seconds behind. The only reason he didn't stay 0.5sec behind Ocon was because Williams wanted to save the tires and they were overheating behind Ocon, so Alex backed off. \n\n2) Williams looks progressively quicker every week. Dave Robson, head of vehicle performance has stated that their strategy wasn't to be quickest at the beginning of the year, but rather to balance the car, work out any glaring issues (like porpoising which they anticipated), and ensure that everything was functional and correlating with their wind tunnel and computational upgrades. Dorilton is still investing heavily, and these infrastructure enchantments don't come overnight, so they wanted to ensure everything's on course before seeking more performance. Dave Robson said that the two main priorities now are to get the car lower without inducing porpoising, and to increase downforce unilaterally to keep its current balance (which it's very balanced right now). He expects exponential performance improvements within the next three weeks.\n\n3) Nicolas Latifi. He's taken the brunt of extremely harsh criticism, so it's only fair to point out when he excels. After lap 33, he gained more and more confidence, consistently running 1:21.1-6's which was quicker than Ricciardo, Zhou, Schumacher, Magnusson, Hamilton, Gasly, Albon, Ocon, and even at times quicker than Russell and Norris. That's extremely impressive. I watched his onboard and there was a switch that seemingly turned on after lap 33. It just clicked. Will he continue this pace forward? I have no idea. Will he crash? I have no idea. Nevertheless, he deserves to be recognized for his relatively rapid pace for over half the GP.

143,z_1JIMi5KN8,"[""I wanted to comment about Andretti story. It is ridiculous that F1 management demands from Andretti for them to show they are serious competitor with enough resources and enough money and enough exposure in USA so that marketing would be right.\r\nFirst off, Andretti is competing with huge success for YEARS in IndyCar Series but also Indy Lights, Indy Pro 2000, Formula E, Extreme E and Supercars Championship. How much more serious you need to get?\r\nSecondly, the first point already proves that they have resources to build, maintain and develop the car and the team. Otherwise, they would be racing in back of the pack, which is not the case.\r\nThirdly, you have to have huge amounts of money to compete in all those series (and be successful at the same time). What is more, with the success Andretti had, it also shows it is money well spent. What is more, Andretti stated already he is willing to pay mandatory F1 entry fee 200 milions of USD (which is then distributed to all other F1 teams as compensation of future lower income - prize pot is pretty much the same, but there would be one more team to share the money with. But hear also this - Andretti wouldn't get ANY money from F1 management for one or two years just because they are new team to the series.)\r\nLastly, Andretti is known as motorsport figure. His name is called the synonymous of speed, just as Stirling Moss - we are talking here about Mario Andretti. When it comes to Andretti family, they are bound to motorsport for several decades. Mario is last American F1 Champion (!) which he won in 1978 driving Lotus with Ford engine, he also won 12 races. Mario also won 4 IndyCar titles, Indy 500 and Daytona 500. Mario's son - Michael, also a competetive driver himself and he now runs the team business. Then we have Marco, Michael's son, who also is a driver, who competed in IndyCar, American Le Mans Series, Formula E and couple other series. I mean, damn, do you feel the marketing potential here? Please also add Colton Herta, who is widely considered a huge talent and is now a development driver for McLaren F1 team.\r\nTaking all this into consideration one must ask themself - what is wrong with F1? What the heck do they really want? And how the hell F1 allowed such a joke of a team of Haas into the series? Well, imho there is one answer - Hass is no danger to the top teams, Andretti very much can be, and which team in their right mind would allow another serious competitor into F1 circus? That's why they do not want Andretti in F1, because they might be too good to beat or to compete with, especially with budget cap (remember, Haas is planning their ONE AND ONLY update for Hungaroring, next they will be focusing on 2023 car :D McLaren is also out of major updates for this year. What a bad joke :D)."", 'It‚Äôs not right that two teams in F1 actually have 4 drivers since it‚Äôs actually two teams and not one. This allows them to groom younger drivers.

The only reason LH44 & MV33 were even close at the end of ‚Äò21 was because Hamilton refused to drive sloppy like we saw from Verstappen. I‚Äôve seen every GP that MV33 has raced in and 2021 was a regression for Verstappen. All this throw the car to the inside and let whoever MV is trying to pass deal with it. MV drives almost hysterically in the opening laps of Silverstone, bounces off Hamilton‚Äôs side pod and suddenly becomes the victim?

It's sad that there aren't more car brands that didn't join the sport eventually but I think the most important aspect was that the car brands knew they could only help smaller teams for a rise to have an important factor in the sport or be a big sponsor to a team.

They are not going to watch an hour quali on friday, an hour race on saturday and a full 2 hour race on sunday.\nIf the goal is to make more attractive races, it won't work. By giving a 1/3th extra racedistance teams will have a lot more data on tires etc. and the main race will become even more predictable, since every team will get closer to the full potential of the car and have a better understanding of the ideal strategy. Besides, with such a short race without pitstops and strategy and the inherent problem of the difficulty of overtaking in current F1, those sprint races will be just parades."", 'I think it would be fun to watch but pushing the engines more on a Saturday might mean more breakdowns which means spending more money which i thought F1 was against.', 'Well I‚Äôm up for it']"

His next 6 World Titles were achieved in THE MOST DOMINANT CAR IN THE HISTORY OF FORMULA 1!

Only Ferrari and teams from the bottom of grid such as Williams and Haas seems to be stuck in the past and are not willing to make the change because one of the reasons to go for wide nose is that suspension parts are easier to fit into a wider nose, which is one of the struggles Marcedes had to overcome when they went with that design. Performance wise, narrow nose is better in corners and lower speeds where most of the time on track can be lost while wide nose only performs well on high speed straights and is struggling in corners so they end up losing that precious time.

They just weren't able to develop the car, they claimed they had a fundamental issue with the car meaning it couldn't be developed more. The fact they were initially faster then the works team in their first year with that engine is a huge achievement as the works team develops the engine to suit their own car and once they ironed out that fundamental problem in 2019 we saw them dominate the mid-field. Even in the Honda years, they were always surprisingly fast on tracks that weren't as dependent on power, something people conveniently seem to forget.\n\nI will say though, McLaren didn't leave much room for Honda to develop things successfully and because they wanted a tight package it did cause more problems for Honda.

When everyone knows the technological tools available, it is implementation that makes the difference.  In this environment, it is people and their management that matter the most.\n\nIn the 80s and 90s, technology in F1 was in the hands of a few.  Teams like McLaren and Williams dominated, not by inventing new technology, but taking technology from aerospace, electronics and other highly engineered fields, and then applying these technologies to motor sports.  Virtually NOTHING in F1 has ever been truly new technology.  The advantage has always come from applying the technology to a new use - motorsports.  Carbon fiber?  Used for years in aerospace.  Active suspension and automatic gearboxes? Those are basically control systems problems that high speed machinery manufacturers and aerospace controls designers were very familiar with.  Etc. etc.\n\nBy 2000, the rules had reigned in technology, and winning primarily became a function of having the right (huge) budget, having the right people, and running a great organization.  I did not say driver, because if you have those things, you will eventually end up with top driving talent.  Sometimes it works the other way too.  Schumacher was successful at Ferrari by doing what Prost failed to do - improving Ferrari to make it a well managed organization, at least to the extent possible with passionate Italians.  But success was dependent on having a healthy well managed operation.  Frank Williams had a history of treating people poorly at all levels.  From drivers to designers to low level technical staff, his organizations were not healthy.  Basically, Williams has had crappy leadership and management.  In the 80s and 90s that could be overcome.  But in the modern era, it could not.  \n\nIt is as simple as that.', ""Let's hope Dorilton can turn things around for 2022 with the new changes and the leveling of the field.\nFinishing top 5 in 2022 is doable.""]"

HPD signed an extension to provide engines in IndyCar, when a team Ganassi, or Andretti car wins it wins as a Honda, and the championship goes to the driver, team, engine manufacture not the constructor. In IMSA the team, drivers, engine win the race be it Cadillac, Acura, Mazda and as the LMDh comes to fruition the same will be true regardless of the sponsor. With the IMSA cars able to run globally in WEC, and the possibility that with both IMSA and IndyCar moving to a set hybrid design the relevance grows well cost in contained and for a global market.  Toto made the point that the Mercedes McLaren works relationship did not have sufficient ROI as it did not brand Mercedes, and with McLaren being a road car constructor this was even further diluted. Similarly even with Aston Martin set to be removed from Red Bull's cars there isn't enough glory to Honda for the money. \nEven though HPD has played it down, there are rumors that Honda has looked at NASCAR in the U.S. this makes sense in that the chassis and the majority of the body is spec. The styling for the nose and tail are all that is open, along with the engine minimizing cost to participate. \n\nI suspect the money saved by leaving F1 which they realize they aren't going to win, if invested in motorsports will find it's way to LMDh, and WEC hypercar. With LeMans looking to introduce Hydrogen power to the game which is carbon neutral, it would be a wise investment for Honda. \n\nI mentioned that the Concorde agreement hurts Honda, with a $200 million buy in price to the series, low potential to earn prize money, the chance of a constructor willing to enter and pay Honda as a customer team is less than likely, especially since unlike Mercedes, Ferrari or Renault (Alpine), Honda can supply the rest of the parts a new entry might want to buy ala HAAS."", 'Unsubscribe to Autosport - Subscribe to The Race!', 'Yes our chonki bois is back', ""I'm so pleased I found this it's so great to see Ed, Scott, Glen, and Mark Hughes!!!

I've had a little war with these people in Forza 4 and all of a sudden, these cars with wings came flying down from the sky,picked my car off the race track,and flew me way off the track out in the desert, and dropped me from the sky into the sand and abandoned me! Pretty funny. Another incident, someone intentionally wrecked someone intentionally, the other driver then changed from being upsidedown to right side up way faster than it would have normally have taken,and sped up to attacker at a supersonic speed and extracted revenge on them! I heard them talking briefly on the microphone. It sounded something like an angry Nick Diaz from the U.F.C. !  I see they now have cars in Horizon 4 now that are not real life cars, but they have 700,000 foot pounds of brake force and are very fast! Can do the Nordschleife in four minutes!

Raising the ride height solves both problems.  \n\nIt looks like the FIA agree with you Tommo.  \n\nI wonder which teams will find that they have one or both cars judged unsafe.

They have all the telemetry, driver mandates that you must keep below X 'force', however you get there is up to you and if you can maintain a low ride height and a fast car without inducing really bad porpoising then congratulations you have a fast car."", 'So couple things I thought about while pondering about the issue.\n\nPutting together a few things that have been said by the teams since pre-season testing, the issue might be more complicated than a simple ride height adjustment.\n\nWhen we arrived in pre-season testing, pretty much every team said they were surprised by the amount of porpoising, because they couldn\'t recreate the effect in the wind tunnel. On top of that, we have Mercedes, the team managed to actually have the least amount of porpoising of any car in Barcelona (according to the data from Jolyon Palmer\'s Analysis). Merc also had their best pace relative to the top 2 in that race. \n\nNow, Barcelona is a higher downforce track than Baku, so you would expect that the team would be less compromising on ride height there than in Baku. However, the one thing that did come out during the race in Azerbaijan is the track surface being extremely bumpy. Meanwhile, Barcelona was resurfaced relatively recently.\n\nSo hear me out: What if Ride Height doesn\'t matter when bumps bring the car down low enough to reach the point where it makes the amount of downforce that causes porpoising to start. This would also explain why teams can have no porpoising on the perfectly flat floor of a wind tunnel, and then tons of it once on track.\n\nIf that\'s the case, then raising the ride height is pointless, because the car will still be able to be sucked in when it hits a hard enough bump to drop the car. And then the cycle of porpoising would not stop until the car slowed down enough.\n\nSo the ""solution"" would seem to be stiffer suspension to prevent the car from getting that low. But that raises it\'s own safety and technical concerns. Are we really better off with drivers ending up in a wall when they hit bumps and curbs because the car is too stiff? Or breaking their backs over sausage curbs because the car has no travel? What if some of the cars make so much downforce when close to the ground that no suspension design known by the respective team is stiff enough to keep the car level?\n\nMercedes struggling the most out of this also makes sense, one massive nerf they got this season is the ban of their hydraulic suspension, meaning they lost a lot of work on suspension design and probably don\'t have answers yet on how to fix it.\n\nNow how do we enforce a G-force limit for porpoising if the issue comes from the track surface? Do we have cars braking on the straights in front of other flat out cars if they get too close to the g-force threshold? Again, keeping in mind that bumps potentially nullify the idea of raising the car to eliminate porpoising.\n\nI believe the right solution was already mentioned by Charles Leclerc, re-open development of more advanced suspension designs, like active dampers and/or hydraulic suspensions.']"

Sound: Definitely something to get used to but once you are it will not feel that strange anymore. You even start to think it‚Äòs normal and kind of like it. But hearing it live is definitely better than on TV imo.\n2. Tracks: FE & FIA are pushing to make tracks more fluid by removing tight chicanes that caused a lot of accidents. But as it‚Äòs street racing sometimes you just can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like wanting Monaco to be wider so you see at least more than 1 overtake in a F1 race. You have to take what the infrastructure gives you.\n3. FanBoost: The boost is so little now it won‚Äòt even guarantee you to get next to someone. Therefore something to engange fans but really no gamechanger in the race.\n4. raggidy edge: Most of the drivers coming from other categories say it‚Äòs one of the hardest cars to drive as it‚Äòs low downfore, low grip due to not using slicks and no driving aids like tc or abs. If you watch closely you see the drivers countersteering and locking brakes or crashing by themselves much more than usual. What is true is that the car is too strong so you don‚Äôt get penalized with a broken car when hitting something or someone that quick. But plan is also to make the bodywork weaker from FE side.\n\nNot trying to convince you or saying FE is better than anything with this comment. Everyone can make their own judgement. But I think it‚Äòs important that the motorsport community gives everything a fair chance and as EV‚Äòs are the main topic of all manufacturers we should support it if we want motorsport to stay around for longer on a professional level.

It will end up becoming a celebrity or popularity contest instead of an actual racing contest because only those who are popular will get the advantage of that speed boost.
